As the name says - it's auto-kicker for several stats, which you define.

Possibilities for today:

Kicks for statspadding:
- Best Score
- Kill Streak

Kicks for weapon stats:
- HeadShotRatio/Accuracy on Deagle/REX
- HeadShotRatio/Accuracy on Pistols (excludes Deagle/REX, for accuracy it won't kick also Scattergun/Nosferatu/EASY-Piece)
- HeadShotRatio/Accuracy on Bolt-Action Sniper-Rifles (you can easily turn that one off)
- HeadShotRatio/Accuracy on Semi-Auto Sniper-Rifles
- HeadShotRatio/Accuracy on all other full auto-weapons (SMG, LMG, Assault-Rifles, VSS, VSS+3, SVU-A, SVU-A+3)

How to install ? Just check the video from youtube :)
